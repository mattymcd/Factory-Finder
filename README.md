# Scraping Hacker News
 
##Learning Competencies 
- Install a gem
- Use the Nokogiri gem to parse CSS elements 
- Map data within a given object (ie Nokogiri object) to a customized object
- Use ARGV to take in user input from the command line
- Use the OpenURI built-in module to open and read live URLs

##Summary 

 We're going to write a simple [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) scraper.  We have to be polite, though: if we're too aggressive we'll get the DBC network banned.

We're going to build Ruby classes that represents a particular Hacker News comment thread.  The main goal is to translate a pre-existing object model &mdash; in this case, Hacker News' model &mdash; into one that's easy for us to manipulate.


##Releases

###Release 0: Objectifying a static Hacker News page 

#### Save a HTML Page

First, we're going to save a specific post as a plain HTML file for us to practice on.  As we're developing a scraper we'll be tempted to hammer the HN servers, which will almost certainly get everyone temporarily banned.  We'll use the local HTML file to get the scraper working before we create a "live" version.

Note that this implies something about how your class should work: it shouldn't care *how* it gets the HTML.

Visit the Hacker News homepage and click through to a specific post.  If you can't find one, use the [A/B Testing Mistakes](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5003980) post.  You can save the HTML for this page somewhere one of two ways.

1. Right click the page and select "view source."  Copy and paste the HTML into Sublime and save the file.
2. Alternatively, open Terminal, make a `hn_scraper` directory, `cd` into it, and run the following command:

   ```text
   $ curl https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5003980 > post.html
   ```

   This will create a `post.html` file which contains the HTML from the URL you entered.  You're free to enter another URL.

#### Playing around with Nokogiri

First, make sure the `nokogiri` gem is installed.  We'll use this to parse the HTML file.  You can test this by running `irb` and typing

```ruby
require 'nokogiri'
```

If you get an error that means Nokogiri is not installed, install it by running this command:

```text
$ gem install nokogiri
```

You'll want to have the [Nokogiri documentation about parsing an HTML document](http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html) available.  Try this from `irb`:

```ruby
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(File.open('post.html'))
```

Make sure you're in *the same directory as `post.html`*.

What does the Nokogiri object itself look like?  Don't worry about having to wade through its innards, but reading [Parsing HTML with Nokogiri](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/html-parsing/) from [The Bastard's Book of Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/) can give you a feel for how Nokogiri works.

Here's an example of how you'd write a method that takes a Nokogiri document of a Hacker News thread as input and return an array of commentor usernames:

```ruby
def extract_usernames(doc)
  doc.search('.comhead > a:first-child').map do |element|
    element.inner_text
  end
end
```

*Remember [CSS selectors](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/)?  You don't need to fully understand all the elements here, but a refresher could help!*

What do these other Nokogiri calls return?  

```ruby
doc.search('.subtext > span:first-child').map { |span| span.inner_text}

doc.search('.subtext > a:nth-child(3)').map {|link| link['href'] }

doc.search('.title > a:first-child').map { |link| link.inner_text}

doc.search('.title > a:first-child').map { |link| link['href']}

doc.search('.comment > font:first-child').map { |font| font.inner_text}
```

What is the data structure?  Can you call ruby methods on the returned data structure?

Make sure you open up the html page in your browser and poke around the source code to see how the page is structured. What do their tags actually look like?  How are those tags represented in the Nokogiri searches?

**Choose at least one other attribute to add for your comments class.  What other comment-related data from the html page can you include?  Figure out your own Nokogiri call to pull in the data.**


#### Creating Your Object Model

We want two classes: `Post` and `Comment`.  A post has many comments and each comment belongs to exactly one post.  Let's build the `Post` class so it has the following attributes: `title`, `url`, `points`, and `item_id`, corresponding to the title on Hacker News, the URL the post points to, the number of points the post currently has, and the post's Hacker News item ID, respectively.

Additionally, create two instance methods:

1. `Post#comments` returns all the comments associated with a particular post
2. `Post#add_comment` takes a `Comment` object as its input and adds it to the comment list.

You'll have to design the `Comment` object yourself.  What attributes and methods should it support and why?

We could go deeper and add, e.g., a `User` model, but we'll stop with `Post` and `Comment`.

### Loading Hacker News Into Objects

We now need code which does the following:

1. Instantiates a `Post` object
2. Parses the Hacker News HTML
3. Creates a new `Comment` object for each comment in the HTML, adding it to the `Post` object in (1)

Ship it!


###Release 1: Objectify a live Hacker News page 

#### Command line + parsing the actual Hacker News

We're going to learn two new things: the basics of parsing command-line arguments and how to fetch HTML for a website using Ruby.  We want to end up with a command-line program that works like this:

```text
$ ruby hn_scraper.rb https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5003980
Post title: XXXXXX
Number of comments: XXXXX
... some other statistics we might be interested in -- your choice ...
$
```
First, [read this blog post about command-line arguments in Ruby](http://alvinalexander.com/blog/post/ruby/how-read-command-line-arguments-args-script-program).  How can you use `ARGV` to get the URL passed in to your Ruby script?

Second, read about Ruby's [OpenURI](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/OpenURI.html) module.  By requiring `'open-uri'` at the top of your Ruby program, you can use open with a URL:

```ruby
require 'open-uri'

html_file = open('http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/OpenURI.html')
puts html_file.read
```

This captures the html from that URL as a `StringIO` object, which NokoGiri accepts as an argument to `NokoGiri::HTML`.

Combine these two facts to let the user pass a URL into your program, parse the given Hacker News URL into objects, and print out some useful information for the user.
